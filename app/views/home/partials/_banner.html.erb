                  "On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike
                  men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of
                  the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain
                  and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those
                  who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as
                  saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly
                  simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice
                  is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we
                  like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided.
                  But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the
                  obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have
                  to be repudiated and annoyances accepted."

                  It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the
                  readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using
                  Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters,
                  as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like
                  readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors
                  now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for
                  'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy.
                  Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident,
                  sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).

                  There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the
                  majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or
                  randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are
                  going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't
                  anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem
                  Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as
                  necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It
                  uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful
                  of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks
                  reasonable.
